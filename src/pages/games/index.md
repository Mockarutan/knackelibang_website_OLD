## DioLight(?)

DioLight is at it's its core a coop FPS in the same vein as Left-4-Dead, with a focus on hight motability, overpowered weapons and gigantic sawm of enemies. The player must together navigate a surreal world-scape, finding and hunting down special enemies! 

Let the hunt begin!

As our first game-project at Knackelibang, DioLight is partly made as a "test-bed" for crazier ideas and mechanics for a possible larger project down the road.
