**JUST READ THE INSTRUCTIONS** is a co-op first person shooter game where the only thing that matters is following the next set of instructions. Enemies will flood the scene, your weapons will break, more instructions will come, and then repeat.

**Aspire to not die.**

****

That is the description for the game we are making. It is what DioLight has become. The game will have most of the component from DioLight, that is; lots of enemies, very powerful weapons, big focus of maps with some strangeness to them.

**The big addition** to the design is the instructions, the game will be centered around following instructions. All sorts of instructions will come during the game session and when all of them are completed, the exit door will open. The instructions can be anything: kill all enemies, get to the next door, follow the red line, hug the streetlights or activate the terminals? The instructions will ask for strange things.

**In the future** there will be a **free** vertical slice demo with a few maps and instructions to get some hype going and feedback on the game, then we'll see where we go from there, but hopefully big things will happen 2021.
